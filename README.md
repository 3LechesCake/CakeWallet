The real power of Ethereum is in being able to interact with tokens in an intuitive and simple way. CakeWallet and TokenScript together are working on the next generation of token usability; unlocking the real power and convenience of tokens. This is what sets us aside from other wallets - we are the wallet for token control and interaction.
